In this folder we have few example classes that you can copy and use. 

If you want to use MW in the object-oriented way we have ported the functions of branch 0.742.3 to objects.  https://github.com/microweber/Microweber/tree/0.742.3

This was done as experiment to test performance imromevents. 

What we have found is that calling Objects is a lot slower than calling pure PHP functions. 

The classes here are just for example purposes to show you how you can make your own. 

If you want to use them the way the are now you have to move them to the "application/classes/mw/" folder.

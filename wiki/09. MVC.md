## Starting

To run mw you must include the `\src\Microweber\bootstrap.php` file which loads up the system. 

This file also contains the *autoloader* which load the classes of the app 

```php
//from index.php
 define('MW_ROOTPATH', dirname((__FILE__)) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR);
require_once (MW_ROOTPATH . 'src/Microweber/bootstrap.php');

$application = new \Microweber\Application($path_to_config);

// get stuff
$content = $application->content->get("is_active=y");
var_dump($content);

```



## Autoloader

The autoloader will include the needed classes automatically when you ask for them. 

There is no need to create any class. It will be done for you on the fly.

By default the autoloader looks in the `\src\Microweber` folder, but you can change that.

```php
// You can add your custom classes folders
// and completely override and replace any mw class

$my_classes = MW_ROOTPATH . 'src/Microweber/examples/classes/';
autoload_add($my_classes);

//you can add as many directories as you want
autoload_add($dirname);

```


## The Application Class
You can think of this class as a constructor of your app and dependency injector. 

It provides properties of the application via the autoloader with the magic methods `__get()` and `__set()`

For example:

When you call the function `$application->content->get()` the class `Content` will be loaded which provides the `get()` method


 
## Controllers and Routing
Define a controller for your application and route to its methods
 
``` php

// Starting App
$application = new \Microweber\Application();

// Starting Controller
$controller = new \Microweber\Controller($application);

// Starting Router
$router = new \Microweber\Router();

// Automatically map the Router to all controller functions
$router->map($controller);

// Extend and override the Controller
$controller->hello_world = function () {
    echo "Hello world!";
};

// Map more complex routes with regex, the Router is using preg_match
$controller->functions['test/route/*'] = function () {
    echo "You can use wildcards!";
};

// Run the website
$router->run();

```


## Views 

As any MVC framework, Microweber allows you to separate the page layout from the "business logic" of your application with Views

The Views are simple php or html files that hold the layout of the information you want to display

You can see working example in the file [src/Microweber/examples/creating_views.php](https://github.com/microweber/microweber/blob/master/src/Microweber/examples/creating_views.php "")

**Creating a view**


```php

 $layout = new \Microweber\View('full_path_to_file.php');
 $layout->content = 'Hello world!';
 $layout->another_variable = array('test', 'test2');
  
 // display output with $layout->display(); or print it
 print $layout;

```

**Calling from controller**

You can call views from the *any file* or from your custom controller

```php

$controller->my_view = function () {
    $view = new  \Microweber\View($full_path_to_file);
    $view->set('content', 'I assigned variable to a view!');

    print $view;
}; 

```

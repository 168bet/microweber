# Modules


The Microweber modules will help you to make easy modifications and add functionality to your pages.

Every module is a PHP script or a program that executes when the user have dropped it into a page.
It can be very simple, or it can be hugely complex, there are no limitations.


The module works as a stand alone script, but it have access to all Microweber functions.

It can also have editable regions and the user can edit the text into it.


Modules are loaded with the \<module /> tag and each of them is located in `userfiles/modules/{$module_name}`: 
```html

      <module type="pictures" />

```
